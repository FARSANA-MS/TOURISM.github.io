        <h3>THIRUVANANTHAPURAM</h3><br>
        <p>Trivandrum (or Thiruvananthapuram) is the capital of the southern state of Kerala. The place is known for its idyllic beaches and rich culture because of which it draws tourists from all over the country. Trivandrum is also one of the cleanliest cities in India. Even after being the capital city and one of the most developed cities of the state it is still a far call from the maddening rush of the metropolitans. Hill stations, serene beaches, backwaters and lagoons make it an ideal holiday destination. The place is also well known for its diverse flora and fauna and is also a major attraction for medical tourists learning Ayurveda.</p>

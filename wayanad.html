With high and low a hill in separate areas, this district is a sleepy one. Earlier, Wayanad was known as Mayakshetra, which turned into Mayanad, and finally it was popularised as Wayanad. Fondly known as ‘The Land of Paddy Fields’ amid the native tribes of this region, Wayanad is atop the Western Ghats at an altitude of 2100m. This is the only district of Kerala that borders both Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The most attractive feature of Wayanad is the forests, which are as old as 3,000 years.</p>

        <h3>IDUKKI</h3><br>
        <p>Idukki is a district created in 1972 in the state of Kerala. It is one of the most nature rich areas of Kerala and remains untouched by commercial tourism. The district is known for its dams and hydroelectric power plants over the numerous rivers that flow through the area and the rich forests that are home to indigenous flora and fauna. Unlike popular hill stations and tourist places of Kerala, Idukki is still relatively unknown to a lot of people, which is why it packed with many places to visit and experience</p>
